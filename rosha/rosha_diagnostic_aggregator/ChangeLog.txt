Change Log and known issues:
---------------------------

This document reports changes in the software and known issues that need attention.


Changes:

13.09.13	No-evidence-Update function integrated, to infer without new evidences (dki)
16.09.13	support to change the observation history settings as a global parameter. Be aware of this. (dki)


Known Issues:

- no model merging. Build one model out of all part models.
- no continiously DBN "history". When all the evidence drops out of the observation queue than the Probs jump back to the a-priori case.
- no documentation, no unit tests, no illustrative example.
